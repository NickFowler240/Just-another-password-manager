Your-average-password-manager
Welcome to the home for my CYB220 Programming Final!

This is a "fairly" secure password manager that I made and hopefully patched all the holes in.
My goal was for it to be clean, not the most secure thing in its class.

To install the password manager, simply run the pwmgr.py file and it will add all required directories for the manager. 
An uninstall option is located within the script to reverse these additions, after which you are free to delete the manager safely.

Thank you for reading and hopefully you at least think this is neat, hopefully in the future it will have some sort of GUI.
This is meant to be used as a template of sorts for further building.

Enjoy!

Your friend,
Nick.
